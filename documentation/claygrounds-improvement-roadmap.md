   - Add error tracking and aggregation
   - Create error reporting dashboard
   - Set up error alerts for critical issues
   - Improve error context and stack traces

2. **Fast Reload & Development Experience**
   - Implement Vite HMR optimization
   - Add fast refresh for React components
   - Optimize module bundling
   - Implement state preservation during reloads
   - Add development tools integration

3. **Content Security Policy Implementation**
   - Add CSP headers to Netlify configuration
   - Configure essential security directives
   - Test for content blocking issues

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement virtualized lists for large datasets
   - Optimize effect dependencies
   - Add loading states for better UX

### Phase 2: Code Quality (Months 1-2)

1. **PropTypes Implementation**
   - Add PropTypes to all components
   - Document component interfaces
   - Implement defaultProps

2. **PDF Generation Optimization**
   - Implement chunked generation
   - Add progress indicators
   - Optimize content generation

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Months 3-4)

1. **Data Indexing**
   - Implement indexing for common filters
   - Optimize search operations
   - Create cached query results

2. **Web Worker Integration**
   - Move CSV processing to web workers
   - Implement background processing
   - Add progress reporting

### Phase 4: Future Enhancements (Months 5+)

1. **TypeScript Migration**
   - Plan incremental migration
   - Create TypeScript configuration
   - Start with utility functions
   - Gradually convert components

2. **Service Worker Implementation**
   - Add offline capabilities
   - Implement asset caching
   - Create notification system
   - Add background sync

## Success Metrics

- Time to interactive under 3 seconds
- Smooth scrolling (60fps) for lists
- PDF generation under 5 seconds
- Memory usage under 100MB
- Hot reload time under 500ms
- Development build time under 3 seconds

### Error Logging Goals
- 100% error capture rate
- Error context available for all errors
- Error reporting latency under 1 second
- Error aggregation and trending
- Critical error alerts within 1 minute
- Error dashboard with real-time updates

### Code Quality Goals
- 80%+ PropTypes coverage
- 0 ESLint errors
- Documented components: 90%+
- Type safety through PropTypes/TypeScript
- Consistent naming conventions

### Security Requirements
- A+ security headers score
- Proper CSP implementation
- ✅ Secure environment variable handling
- ✅ Secure authentication flow

## Risk Management

### Key Considerations
1. Test thoroughly before merging changes
2. Implement features incrementally
3. Monitor performance metrics
4. Have rollback plans ready

### Priority Order
1. Content Security Policies
2. Performance optimizations (virtualization)
3. Code quality enhancements (PropTypes)
4. Advanced features (TypeScript, Service Workers)
